I am a PhD candidate in economics at the New School for Social Research and a visiting doctoral student at the Paris School of Economics (PSE). I am a member of the [**Latin American Society for the History of Economic Thought (ALAHPE)**](https://alahpe.org/en/) and also a [**2022 Summer Research Grantee of the History & Political Economy Project**](https://www.hpeproject.org/2022grantees) of the Arrighi Center for Global Studies at the Johns Hopkins University (Washington D.C.). Recently, I was awarded with the [**Warren J. and Sylvia J. Samuels Young Scholar Prize**](https://historyofeconomics.org/young-scholars/) to attend the 49th Annual Meeting of the History of Economics Society (Minneapolis, USA). 

My current research focuses on the study of income inequality and political conflict, the history of neoliberalism, and the political economy of precarious work. One of my chapters is titled "Waves of Neoliberalism: Revisiting the Authoritarian Capitalism in South America" and explores how transnational intellectual networks have framed economic development and incepted neoliberal common sense in Peru since the 1940s (an alternative narrative to the Chicago-Boys history). In my other project, "Long-run Income Inequality in 20th Century Peru", I intend to reconstruct the Distributional National Accounts (DINA) for the Peruvian economy using long-run factor income shares, inheritance and microeconomic income data.
