abstract: A current problem with Latin American economies is the lack of long-run official statistical data for income shares. Nevertheless, several proposals attempt to present estimations to proxy the evolutionary patterns of income distribution in different countries of the region. This study focuses on the factor income distribution for the Peruvian economy. It aims to show time series for the wage, profit, and mixed-income shares for the period 1942-2019 as reconstructed in Castillo (2015). I also present a brief history of the Peruvian macroeconomic regimes. Hence, the evolution of the wage and profits shares relate to the structural transformations of the Peruvian economy and the impact of economic policy in the distributive cycles. The paper ends with the estimation of a Kaleckian model and evaluates the economic growth regime for different time periods. While the whole 1940-2019 is a wage-led growth regime, economic growth in the Neoliberal era 1990-2019 is profit-led because of Peruvian structural changes and 1990s adjustment policies.
