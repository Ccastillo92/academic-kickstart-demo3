abstract: The effects of pandemics on inequalities are analyzed, but also from inequalities as an explanatory element of the major negative impacts of pandemics. Also, the elements that explain the impacts of the high inequality in the economic, social and political areas are established. On the other hand, while optimistic and pessimistic views coexist about the impacts of technological change on the levels of employment and inequality, negative ones predominate. There are already some evidences that companies are investing in technology to adapt their production processes to protect themselves against current and future pandemics. the hypothesis that the covid-19 pandemic drives technological changes aggravating unemployment and high inequality is not rejected.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
#summary: This paper proposes a double-sided definition based on Vajda (1976) and Paxton (1998) to understand fascism as a movement and an ideology. That #enables us to identify the Peruvian fascism by studying the actions and ideas of three intellectuals who sympathized with it, José de la Riva-Agüero, Raúl #Ferrero Rebagliatti, and Víctor Andrés Belaúnde. I argue that their discourse is a symbiosis between Peruvian authoritarian political tradition and European #fascisms. Even though these fascist intellectuals did not create a strong political movement, they incepted political concepts regarding social policy, the #government, the nation, the relations between State and the church, and anti-Marxism in public discussion.
